## Overview

**Jules Android Client** allows developers and project managers to interact with the Jules coding agent on the go. This application provides a full-featured interface to control your Jules sessions, review generated plans, and communicate directly with the AI agent to modify your projects.

This project was crafted using **Vibe Coding** methodologies, leveraging advanced AI assistance to rapidly prototype, iterate, and implement robust functionality.

Whether you need to check the status of a task, approve a critical code change, or start a new refactoring session, this app puts the power of Jules in your pocket.

## Features

*   **Session Management**: View a comprehensive list of all active and past sessions.
*   **Create Sessions**: Quickly initialize new sessions with custom prompts and select specific source contexts from your project.
*   **Interactive Chat**: Communicate with the Jules agent in real-time. Send instructions, ask questions, and view the full conversation history.
*   **Plan Approval**: Review and approve execution plans generated by the agent (`AWAITING_PLAN_APPROVAL` state) to proceed with code modifications.
*   **Activity Log**: detailed chronological view of all session activities, including agent responses, system events, and errors.
*   **Source Selection**: Integrated support for selecting project sources/contexts when starting a session.

## Usage

1.  **Start a Session**: Tap the `+` FAB on the home screen. Enter your instruction (e.g., "Refactor the LoginActivity") and select the relevant source file/module.
2.  **Chat**: Tap on any session to enter the detail view. Type messages at the bottom to guide the agent.
3.  **Review Plans**: When the agent proposes a change, a "View Plan" or "Approve" button will appear. Review the proposed steps and confirm to let the agent execute the changes.
