## Overview

**Jules Android Client** allows developers and project managers to interact with the Jules coding agent on the go. This application provides a full-featured interface to control your Jules sessions, review generated plans, and communicate directly with the AI agent to modify your projects.

This project was crafted using **Vibe Coding** methodologies, leveraging advanced AI assistance to rapidly prototype, iterate, and implement robust functionality.

Whether you need to check the status of a task, approve a critical code change, or start a new refactoring session, this app puts the power of Jules in your pocket.
